## Project Charter

The first example of work is a project charter we created in order to plan out our fictional companies staffing in an official document. We also designated a budget and a method as to how we were going to approach the whole assignment. The goal was to make a plan as if we were a real company preparing to develop a plan for making an interactive UI for a business to be able to track inventory efficiently. 

## Work Break Down Schedule

My work break down schedule took a lot of time to complete and I am particularly proud of it. No one else in my group could figure out how to work it properly so I had to do it all myself and teach them what I had done afterwards if they were interested. I had also myself missed a lot of the lecture showing us how to work it due to computer problems, having to instead teach myself the majority of the functions. The end result is very attractive and functional. 

## Project Plan

The project plan was the last part of our project. It was our official documentation of the entire plan we had developed along with pricing and a responsibility matrix for my team. I made the document as official as we could on my own. We outlined the maintenance plan, communications, costs, roles, requirements and resources in this document. I also defined the plan initially so we would have an official record of what the plan we had in place would be.
