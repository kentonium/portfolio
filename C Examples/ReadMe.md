## Demo 1 - Bank Statement

The first demo is the final product of an assignment with the goal of producing multiple bank accounts and types of accounts. The purpose was to test it a variety of ways to ensure a customer at an ATM could not do anything illegal, such as withdraw more money than they had stored in their account, or go over their withdrawal limit. The accounts are run through multiple different scenarios over and over again to ensure this is the case. 

## Demo 2 - Swap Arrays

The second demo is a show of capability, using multiple swap types in order to demonstrate how they function. Numbers in arrays are ordered from least to greatest or vice versa. The final swap function is a bubble sort coded manually.
