## Demo 1 – Mail Address, Student List

The first demo is an assignment we were given asking us to create SQL statements that would create a new mailing address and create a list of students. The first was created as a procedure, first checking if the address existed, and if it didn’t, create a new one based on the sent in parameters. The second was more difficult. It required the use of a cursor to jump through the array and display course information along with student information based on a course name input. 

## Demo 2 – Fetch/Exit When, Add Person, Update Client

The second demo is an assignment that required us to make 3 separate PLSQL statements. The first asked us to make a list that displayed consultants in a specified format and totaled the number of consultants. This was completed using a cursor as well to go through the array, pulling out information while tallying a running total. The second was to create a program block that added consultants to the table. This was accomplished with a sequence that was run twice with different information input both times to create two new consultants. There is a substantial amount of error checking in this one to account for all the different errors that could occur during this process. The third part was to update an existing client. This was accomplished in much the same manner except instead of inserting we are updating.
