# General Overview
Portfolio of scripts and projects created by me.

## C++

 C++ was the third coding language I learned. It was not too difficult to get a firm grasp on with the previous language building blocks I had already been taught. The only real challenge was learning the new syntax. This class lasted two terms with two different teachers. This allowed me to get two different views on ways to use C++, although making the course a little tougher.  Initially I resented C++ because it was less explanatory than Visual Basic but over the time functionality of it became very apparent and I started wishing we had begun with this in the first place. It was far easier working with loops and functions in this program once I got the hang of it, and we only skimmed a small portion of the potential from this language. I’m very excited to further my learning in this language with my future careers.
 
# Project Management
 
 This course was one term long and a huge stress test to give us a glimpse into the world of deadlines. There was little guidance to the homework or assignments in this class to give us more of a feel of how it will be in industry when we’re asked to create reports and plans. This was one of the more fun classes to do due to the freedom we had, although stressful at times. It did a very good job at showing us what it will be like when we get out into the IT field. We were shown what we will be required to accomplish and given methods to do it in a timely manner. I created plans for projects in the form of charters and work break down schedules. I also developed use case diagrams and learned how to interview a client, along with multiple other methods of data acquisition, to gain information, and how to derive useful information from the process. 

# SQL

Our SQL class was two terms, initially teaching us basic SQL and then moving on to PLSQL. Both of these terms were in year 1. Everything was taught to us from the very beginning so there was a strong emphasis put on best practice for efficiency in our coding by our teacher. We were also shown how to error check extensively to ensure nothing wrong will make it through to a user. This course was the easiest for me once it got rolling. A lot of the logic makes natural sense to me so as we learned it everything fell neatly into place. 


# Visual Basic

Visual Basic was the first programming language I was taught in the ITPA program. It was a two-term program during first year. The first term was basic programming while the second was working with databases. I had no programming experience beforehand and had little idea of what to expect aside from snippets of code I had seen a few times before schooling. As such, I found it very difficult to adjust to at first with all of the new terminology and methodology. Once we got past the basics into more complicated territory it became easier in the sense that I could write code without looking at examples and I could more easily deduce a solution, since I had more code in my head than on paper. I learned all of the basic loops, properties and some algorithms in this language to build a solid structure for future learning to be placed on top of.

# Web Design

Our web design course was very expansive for what little time we had with it. This course was two terms over two years. The first term taught us the basics in HTML, CSS, cookies with JavaScript, and web parameters. We learned how to send information through the URL as well as how to store it on a computer and bring it back with cookies. A fake store was developed with membership registration, check out, contact us page, products pages, calendar and more created mostly by the students ourselves. The second term took us deeper into the code and taught us server side PHP and how to use session variables. This course was almost entirely composed of work periods with less teaching the further into the course we delved. We were given specific requirements for the assignments along with a PDF outlining how to achieve the majority of the requirements. The further into the course the less the PDF’s would tell us of how to accomplish the goals as well. This course was particularly difficult for me to master although also one of my more favorable courses due to enjoyable material. I thoroughly enjoyed making web pages but it was much harder for me than regular programming. 

# Documentation

We did not have a course on documentation, however we did have multiple courses teach us different ways to document our work. Some was through Crystal Reports, some was through Access database, some through diagrams and some through official documents. We learned how to generate reports in such a way that they will hold relevant information and make logical sense to someone viewing them in a professional manner. An eye for detail was stressed by the teacher with reports having to match exactly as it was requested in an assignment.
