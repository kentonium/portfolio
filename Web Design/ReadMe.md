## Demo 1 – Store Layout

This demo is a display of the website design created using a database to fill in products. The code is a full representation of how I created it along with the teacher’s design. I used PHP to allow the page to be fully dynamic and update new inventory from the database. 


##Demo 2 – Contact Us

Here I have an image of my contact us page along with the functioning code that creates it. I have created a JavaScript function that displays an interactive map showing where the business is located as well as included a feature allowing the user to directly E-Mail me about inquiries through their browser by clicking the link provided.


## Demo 3 – Register

Demo 3 is a picture of the registration page I created. This page originally used JavaScript cookies to capture the information provided and store it on the user’s computer. We revamped it to use server side PHP and put the information into a database instead. The information is put through error checking to ensure it is valid and a pop up detailing all missing required fields is displayed if any are left blank.


## Demo 4 – Sign In

This demo is the sign in page. It is not much to look at as the important business is in the back-end PHP. The ID entered is cross referenced with the database to see if it exists. Depending on if it exists or if it is given a wrong password, different information will display to the user prompting further action. When the user signs in, session variables are created to keep track of the shopping cart and the users name through the website to ensure they do not end up with someone else’s products or lose their own cart. When they sign out the session is destroyed.
