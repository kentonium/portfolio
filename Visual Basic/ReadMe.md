## Demo 1 â€“ Roll Dice

This demo is a combination of two different programs being run from one window. One program lets you roll images of dice until all combinations requested are met, at which point it will tell you how many times it took you to roll the dice to get the desired results. The other half generates random numbers from a requested range. Analyzing these numbers will pull out the greatest, smallest, and how many numbers were created. The requirements for this were to comment properly, use proper naming conventions and use the code of best practice to achieve the goal.
