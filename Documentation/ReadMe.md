## Demo 1 – Update Inventory

This demo is taken from our Project Management class. It is a simple example of proper formatting through a flow chart. The flow goes through checking a system to see if an item already exists in a database. If not, the item is added and saved.

## Demo 2- Create PO Number

Demo 2 is a more complicated flow chart to show a more in depth flow. Multiple decisions are encountered as well as passing information to the accounting department. There is also a step where the user must make a decision based on the information available to them to choose which option is best, as opposed to the standard yes or no options.

## Demo 3 – Titles Report 

 We learned how to format reports and create different styles both with and without the use of a wizard during Data Retrieval and Formatting with Oracle. We worked a lot with Crystal Reports to create forms as per specs provided as accurately as possible. This report is fairly simple, but shows proper formatting, grouping, filtering and grand totals properly in a manner that is readable and professional.

## Demo 4 – Course Enrollment

This demo is a more complicated version of a report, including a pie chart with customised labeling to be more relevant to the topic. This report shows grouping, totalling, and formatting. The purpose of this report is to see which courses have the most students, using grouping of the top 5 courses by student count.
